## Slide 1 — **Out‑Innovate, Not Out‑Scale**
**Template:** Format 2 — Typographic Manifesto (light variant) • **Mode:** Light card `#F0F0F0`, black text `#000000` per guide.
**Nav Pill:** INTRO

### 1) Executive intent (what a reader should conclude)
Tata’s path to rival Chinese scale **does not** hinge on replicating grid megawatts or state‑driven centralization. It hinges on **knowledge velocity**: the speed at which we turn raw signals into shared understanding and governed action. **Athinia Foundry’s ONTOLOGY** (with AIP) captures tacit process know‑how as **computable, queryable, and auditable objects**—so *every* engineer can explore, reason, and act like the best specialists, **without waiting** on master–apprentice transfers or new one‑off pipelines.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
Forget siloed expertise. Embrace shared intelligence. Semiconductor excellence has been built by master craftspeople, but scaling that mastery requires **institutional memory** that compounds:
- **One shared semantic spine** (Events, Actors, Activities, Locations, Materials, Products).
- **One governed action layer** (Rules, Approvals, Writeback, Audit).
- **One exploration surface** where engineers ask novel questions **without** re‑wiring data each time.
This is how Tata out‑innovates at speed—and why we prioritize **ONTOLOGY‑first**.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Hero:** “Out‑Innovate, Not Out‑Scale.” (96px/900; LH 1.2, letter 0.05em, center‑left)
- **Openers (48px/700, top‑left):** “Forget Siloed Expertise.” / “Embrace Shared Intelligence.”
- **Body (14px/400, max‑width 640px, bottom‑left):** 3–4 sentences above.
- **Chrome:** Light‑variant nav pill “INTRO”; footer `#4A4A4A`; pagination dots centered.

### 4) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Audience expects charts. **Mitigation:** This is the **manifesto** slide—keep clean; charts follow.
- **Risk:** “Ontology” sounds abstract. **Mitigation:** Orient quickly in Slides 5–7 with concrete object types, lineage, and action flows.

## Slide 2 — **China’s Scale: Centralization at 10 GW (Stake Setting)**
**Template:** Format 5 — Big Number Impact • **Nav Pill:** CONTEXT‑1

### 1) Executive intent
Establish urgency by relaying the **speakers’ view** that China can centralize compute and power **extremely quickly**, setting an upper‑bound benchmark (e.g., **10 GW single‑site potential**) that the West cannot match on timeline—so Tata must optimize **time‑to‑learning**, not megawatts.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
Transcript speakers assert China can:
- **Aggregate >1 million** NVIDIA **H20‑class** GPUs despite constraints, and
- Repurpose heavy‑industry power (e.g., **~5 GW** single aluminum smelters) to stand up **multi‑GW** AI sites in **months** vs. Western **years**, due to faster substation/transformer builds and dense industrial grids.
If even half true, **centralization speed** is the strategic differentiator. Tata wins by shrinking **think→try→learn** cycles, not by copy‑pasting China’s power build‑out.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Hero block:** “**10 GW**” (96px/900) with descriptor “Potential single‑site training cluster (speakers’ view).”
- **Support cards (bottom, two):**
  - “**1,000,000+**” / “H20‑class GPUs (2025 inflow; transcript view).”
  - “**≈5 GW**” / “Single smelter load—redirectable magnitude.”
- **Design:** Chart cards `#2C2C2E`, labels white; tight negative space.

### 4) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** “10 GW” could be misread as present reality.
  **Mitigation:** Use descriptor “potential/feasible upper bound per speakers” and add footnote.

## Slide 3 — **Exposure & IP Risk: Materials + ASML Context**
**Template:** Format 14 — Dual Chart Comparison + Security Context strip • **Nav Pill:** CONTEXT‑2

### 1) Executive intent
Show **why** governance of knowledge is a first‑class requirement: (a) upstream **materials concentration** creates leverage and shock sensitivity; (b) **equipment exposure** persists (e.g., high China share of ASML revenue noted by speakers); (c) speakers allege **ASML hacks** and **document exfiltration**—use as risk framing to justify **Foundry‑grade access, approvals, and audit**.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
- **Materials concentration:** Rare‑earth processing dominance (China) implies **systemic fragility** for magnets and specialty chemical chains—difficult to diversify overnight.
- **Equipment exposure:** Transcript notes **ASML’s large China revenue share** in recent quarters, implying continued DUV/equipment flow influencing non‑EUV node buildouts.
- **Security context (strip):** Speakers claim **ASML has been hacked multiple times**, the **Dutch government was “really pissed off,”** and **civil actions** occurred related to documents reaching China. Present as **speaker‑attributed** risk framing; do **not** adjudicate.

**So‑what for Tata:** Hardware sanctions/levers are necessary **but insufficient**. The **crown jewels** are **process knowledge and decision context**—these require **governed sharing** (access, masking, audit, approvals) to innovate **fast and safely**.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left chart card:** Bar “Rare‑earth processing share (China)” → illustrative 90% axis cap to 100 (monochrome).
- **Right chart card:** Bar “ASML revenue share to China (recent quarter; transcript context)” → illustrative 48%.
- **Bottom strip (72px):** Teal shield “▣” + label pill **SECURITY CONTEXT** + two lines of transcript‑sourced copy.
- **Chrome:** Standard dark mode card; footer note: “Speaker‑attributed context.”

### 4) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Audience treats figures as audited.
  **Mitigation:** Keep “speaker‑attributed” qualifier on‑slide.

## Slide 4 — **The Bottleneck: Master‑Apprentice ≠ Scalable**
**Template:** Format 2 — Typographic Manifesto • **Nav Pill:** PROBLEM

### 1) Executive intent
Name the **real constraint**: tacit know‑how shared via **master–apprentice** chains cannot keep pace with the combinatorics of modern process windows. The fix is to **encode business knowledge** in a **shared ontology** that any team can explore with the right permissions.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
The transcript depicts a **“Sith‑like” master–apprentice chain**: brilliant depth, poor diffusion. As steps and interactions explode (**tool recipes × materials × lots × ambient conditions**), no single expert holds it all. The result is **latency** (answers arrive late) and **fragility** (if the expert is out, the line stalls).
**Foundry’s ONTOLOGY** turns specialist mental models into **computable objects and links** with **governed writeback**, so the organization learns *as a system*—not person by person.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Hero:** “Master‑Apprentice ≠ Scalable.” (72px/700)
- **Sub‑hero:** “Encode tacit knowledge as a shared, governed Ontology.” (32px/500)
- **Body:** Two short paragraphs above (14px/400)
- Minimalist, high‑contrast, no charts—this is the “problem definition” wall.

### 4) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** “Ontology” feels academic.
  **Mitigation:** Slides 5–7 show **structured objects, lineage**, and **actions** with concrete tasks.

---

## Slide 5 — **Why ONTOLOGY ⇒ Velocity (Encapsulating Business Knowledge)**
**Template:** Format 1 — Split (60/40) • **Nav Pill:** SOLUTION‑1

### 1) Executive intent
Explain in **practical terms** how ONTOLOGY converts domain expertise into **exploration speed** and **decision velocity**—outpacing master–apprentice approaches *because* questions can be asked and answered **without** bespoke pipelines or hunting people down.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**The semantic spine**
- **Objects:** **Event** (run, shipment, inspection), **Actor** (tool, team, supplier), **Activity** (etch step, pack, dispatch), **Location** (fab, line, bay, lane), **Material** (wafer, gas, chemical), **Product**.
- **Links:** *occursAt*, *performedBy*, *usesMaterial*, *produces*, *belongsToLot*, *impacts*, *qualifies*.
- **Properties:** timestamps, identifiers, lot/recipe IDs, environmental context, QC attributes.

**Velocity effects**
- **Exploration without re‑ETL:** Analysts and engineers pivot **immediately** from *supplier‑lot* to *tool‑recipe* to *defect class* using relationships—no fresh data modeling for each question.
- **From insight to institutional memory:** Once a pattern is validated, convert it into a **Rule** (with thresholds, owners, SLAs) and a **Template** (reusable views, lineage queries, applets).
- **Continuity by design:** If the expert is out, the **graph still answers**; if someone new joins, they **inherit context** (events, decisions, approvals) rather than scattered slides or DMs.

**Why this beats master–apprentice:**
- Apprentices “**ask a human**.” ONTOLOGY lets them “**ask the system**”—and encodes the answer for the next person.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left (60% text):** The three sub‑sections above; use “→” bullets; keep paragraphs tight.
- **Right (40% diagram):** Minimal node‑link diagram labeled with the actual object names; rounded inner edge 16px; monochrome lines with teal node highlights for **Events**.

### 4) Implementation notes
- **Governed writeback** only: second‑path validation (more in Slide 6).
- **AIP** assists: proposes facts/links; humans approve; **audit** persists.

---

## Slide 6 — **How It Works: Two‑Path Architecture (Fast + Governed)**
**Template:** *Format 1 — Split (60/40), right = mini swimlane*
**Nav Pill:** **SOLUTION‑2**

### 1) Executive intent
Make it crystal‑clear **how** Foundry ONTOLOGY delivers both **speed** and **control**: a **First Path** that normalizes operational feeds into *Events* for instant exploration, and a **Second Path** where **AIP** proposes *facts/links* which **humans validate** before **writeback**—with **Rules** automating actions and **object/link‑level access** guaranteeing governance.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**A. First Path (fast fabric for exploration)**
- **Purpose:** Convert live enterprise streams into a **shared, queryable Event layer** *without* forcing every analyst to learn each source system.
- **Typical feeds:** ERP shipment lines, ASN/carrier milestones, MES WIP moves, SCADA/IoT signals, QC/inspection records.
- **Transformation:** Lightweight mapping → **core Event schema** (EventID, EventType, OccursAt[Location], PerformedBy[Actor], UsesMaterial, Impacts[Product/Lot], Timestamps, SourceRef, Confidence).
- **Latency budget:** Near‑real‑time to **≤ 15 min** for most feeds; **≤ 5 min** for high‑value exceptions.
- **Outcome:** Anyone can pivot **supplier‑lot → tool‑recipe → defect class** in seconds using relationships defined in ONTOLOGY—*no new pipeline*.

**B. Second Path (assisted semantics + human‑in‑the‑loop)**
- **Purpose:** Let **AIP** propose *facts/links* (e.g., “these shipment events *likely* constitute a *Disruption*”; “this pattern suggests a *DefectLineage* from supplier‑lot X to etch step Y”).
- **Human validation UI:** Side‑by‑side view of evidence (events, attributes, time series) with **approve/reject/edit**; provenance always attached.
- **Writeback:** Approved facts/links become **first‑class objects** in ONTOLOGY (e.g., *Disruption*, *DefectLineage*, *CorrectiveAction*).
- **Guardrails:** Confidence thresholds; reviewer roles; dual‑control on high‑impact relations.

**C. Rules & Action Types (from insight → accountable action)**
- **Rules:** Declarative policies that watch the Event graph (e.g., *if* ETA variance > X on *lane A* for top‑N SKUs *then* create *Action* with owner, SLA, and escalation).
- **Action Types:** Typed workflows with forms, approvers, and **writeback** to record **who decided what when and why**.
- **Audit:** Immutable log (actor, object/link, before/after, timestamp, justification).

**D. Governance (security is the feature)**
- **Access model:** Object‑ and link‑level controls; role‑ and attribute‑based policies; **row/field masking** for sensitive attributes; **purpose‑bound** data use where required.
- **Minimization:** Share **just‑enough** views (material class, lane risk scores, masked QC fields) rather than raw tables—especially in cross‑company workspaces (Athinia).

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left (60% text):** Four sub‑sections (A–D) with bold subheads and concise bullet paragraphs; keep lines ≤ 90 chars.
- **Right (40% mini swimlane):**
  - Lane 1: *Sources* → *Normalize* → *Events*
  - Lane 2: *AIP Proposals* → *Human Validate* → *Writeback* (Facts/Links)
  - Lane 3: *Rules* → *Action Types* → *Approvals/Audit*
  - Monochrome connectors; teal nodes for Events/Actions; rounded inner edge **16px**.

### 4) Implementation notes (for architects)
- **ID strategy:** Stable keys per object type (LotID, ToolID, RecipeID, ShipmentID); cross‑source concordance table for deduplication.
- **Temporal reasoning:** Use **validFrom/validTo** per relation; enable **as‑of** queries to recreate state at time‑T.
- **Schema evolution:** Non‑breaking additive properties via versioned ontic types; migration jobs for indexing.

### 5) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Over‑zealous automation. → **Mitigation:** Keep AIP as *proposal*; require reviewer roles and thresholds.
- **Risk:** Scope creep in Events. → **Mitigation:** Start with **pilot domain** (e.g., top 5 lanes + target defects); expand incrementally.

## Slide 7 — **From ‘Tell Me’ to ‘Let Me Explore’ (Measurable Velocity)**
**Template:** *Format 4 — KPI Grid (6 cards)*
**Nav Pill:** **SOLUTION‑3**

### 1) Executive intent
Make “velocity” **measurable** in ways leadership can review weekly. Define precise metrics that prove ONTOLOGY changes how people **ask, learn, and act**.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**Six velocity KPIs (with measurement method):**
1) **Time‑to‑First‑Insight (TTFI)** — Median time from question posed (Jira/Ticket/Slate note) to a **validated analytic finding** (saved query/view with reviewer sign‑off). *Target:* **days → hours/minutes**.
2) **Hypothesis Throughput (HT)** — Number of distinct investigative questions explored **per engineer per week** (count of saved explorations tagged to a case). *Target:* **+2–3×** vs. baseline.
3) **Decision Latency (DL)** — Median time from **exception detection** to **assigned Action** (Rule‑triggered) with owner/SLA. *Target:* **–30–50%**.
4) **Knowledge Reuse Rate (KRR)** — Ratio of **template‑driven runs** (views, lineage queries, applets) to **ad‑hoc** runs. *Target:* **>60%** of usage from templates by Month 6.
5) **Continuity Index (CI)** — % of priority investigations **completed without the original expert** (measures resilience against single‑points‑of‑failure). *Target:* **≥80%**.
6) **Coverage Ratio (CR)** — % of Events/Actors/Activities/Locations **populated** for the pilot scope (completeness, not just volume). *Target:* **100%** pilot coverage.

> **Why these matter:** They capture the shift from **“ask a human”** to **“ask the system”**, the hallmark of ONTOLOGY’s impact on daily work.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Title:** “From ‘Tell Me’ to ‘Let Me Explore’ (Measurable Velocity)”.
- **Six stat cards:** Each card shows **Metric name** (24/700), **target** and **explicit formula/denominator** in body 14/400.
- Card background `#2C2C2E`; consistent gutters; subtle teal ticks for targets.

### 4) Implementation notes (instrumentation)
- **Event logging:** Capture creation of *Saved Exploration*, *Rule Trigger*, *Action Assigned*, *Template Used*.
- **Attribution:** Store *who/when/what*; tag items to cases/projects.
- **Slate dashboard:** Weekly roll‑up with spark‑lines and variance vs. baseline.

### 5) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Vanity metrics. → **Mitigation:** Tie to **business outcomes** in Slide 11 (pilot KPIs).
- **Risk:** Over‑tagging burden. → **Mitigation:** Auto‑tag from UI actions; minimal manual fields.

## Slide 8 — **China’s Centralization (Compute & Power) vs. US‑Style Centralization (Information)**
**Template:** *Format 1 — Split (balanced)*
**Nav Pill:** **CONTEXT‑3**

### 1) Executive intent
Articulate the **strategic contrast**: per the transcript, **Chinese state‑directed centralization** can pick champions, **monopolize GPUs and electricity**, and **integrate isolated industry verticals** (policy lever). The **US answer** is **centralization of information**—*federated and governed*—so collaboration happens at market speed without coercion. *Athinia (on Foundry)* is that vehicle.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**A. Transcript‑attributed view of China’s centralization**
- Speakers argue Beijing could **designate industry leaders**, allocate **scarce GPUs** and **grid capacity**, and **force integration** across suppliers, fabs, and platforms—enabling **single‑site, multi‑GW clusters** in **months**.
- Whether or not this occurs, the key point is **state‑directed coherence** can compress time to massive training runs.

**B. US‑style answer: centralize information, not ownership**
- Rather than nationalize or pick winners, we **federate knowledge**: a shared **Ontology** (events, actors, activities, lineage) that **crosses firm boundaries** with **fine‑grained policies**, **masking**, **audit**, and **revocation**.
- This creates the **functional equivalent** of “vertical integration” *at the information layer*—without moving assets or IP into a single entity.
- **Athinia** operationalizes this *today* for the semiconductor ecosystem—**secure data rooms** across manufacturers, materials/equipment suppliers, and OEM/ODMs—so the ecosystem **learns together**.

**C. Why Tata needs this now**
- To rival China’s speed, Tata must **pull in knowledge from suppliers** (materials variability, lot quality, lane risk), **encode it** alongside internal events, and **act** via Rules—**weekly**. The alternative is waiting for apprenticeships to propagate—**too slow**.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left (China):** A compact narrative with three bullet paragraphs; subtle caution icon denoting *speaker‑attributed* claims.
- **Right (US/ Athinia):** Three bullet paragraphs on federation, policies, and current deployment; a small **“US‑style centralization of information”** sub‑header in teal.
- Include a **footnote**: “China points are *speaker‑attributed*; used for framing.”

### 4) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Perceived political stance. → **Mitigation:** Keep language factual and **attributed**; emphasize the **operating model** we can control.

---

## Slide 9 — **Athinia = US‑Style Centralization of Information (Federated, Governed)**
**Template:** *Format 8 — Customer‑Style Case (capability narrative replacing testimonial)*
**Nav Pill:** **ECOSYSTEM‑1**

### 1) Executive intent
Position **Athinia (on Foundry)** as the *already‑operational* mechanism by which US‑aligned semiconductor players **centralize information**—**safely**—across companies, achieving the **coordination benefits** of centralization without state control or IP leakage.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**A. What Athinia is**
- A **secure data collaboration platform** for the semiconductor ecosystem, **powered by Athinia Foundry**, **commercially deployed since 2022**.
- Enables **cross‑company workspaces** with **granular access control**, **field‑level masking**, **policy enforcement**, **auditing**, and **revocation**.
- Delivers **governed analytics/AI** atop **shared semantics** (not uncontrolled data lakes).

**B. How it works (policy & privacy primitives)**
- **RBAC/ABAC** across **objects, links, and fields**; **masking** for sensitive attributes (e.g., exact recipe params, proprietary QC).
- **Data minimization:** Share **views/aggregates** (e.g., lane risk scores, defect rates by class) rather than raw rows; support **purpose‑bound** usage and **expiry**.
- **Lifecycle controls:** Invitation → scoped access → **usage audit** → **revocation**; all actions are **provable** (who/what/when/why).
- **Interoperability:** Foundry’s ONTOLOGY ensures **Event/Actor/Activity** semantics align across participants; avoids “schema of the week”.

**C. What Tata can do Day‑1**
- Stand up **supplier data rooms** for **priority lanes/materials**; ingest **ASN/carrier**, **QC summaries**, and **lot metadata** under masking.
- Run **shared lineage** from **supplier‑lot → fab step → defect class** with explainable joins; auto‑open **Corrective Actions** spanning firms (owners on both sides).
- Publish **weekly Slate** to all participants: **exceptions, actions, SLAs**, and **learning summaries**; convert successful investigations into **Templates** available to the cohort.

**D. Why this rivals China (informationally)**
- You get **vertical integration effects**—rapid coordination, aligned fixes, reusable patterns—*without* central owners or state mandates.
- As more partners join, **knowledge compounds**; every investigation leaves artifacts (events, links, actions) others can **reuse** under policy.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left panel (dark)**: Replace “testimonial” with a **program statement** in a 24px/italic block:
  > “Athinia centralizes **information**, not ownership—federated, governed, and built to protect IP.”
  Under it, list 3–4 bullet proofs (granular access, masking, audit, since 2022).
- **Right image panel:** A stylized, monochrome network of partner logos/avatars connected to a central *Athinia* hub; rounded inner edge **16px**; subtle teal highlights.

### 4) Implementation notes (for rollout leads)
- **Initial cohort size:** 3–5 strategic suppliers per lane/material class; choose those with **high volume** and **cooperative stance**.
- **Data contracts:** Start with **semantic slim slices** (e.g., lane risk scores, defect class counts, masked feature vectors).
- **KPIs to watch:** Cross‑company **RCA time**, **false‑positive rate** of Rules, **template reuse** across firms.

### 5) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Supplier IP anxiety. → **Mitigation:** Masking, purpose‑bound policies, **revocation guarantees**, and **joint governance board** per workspace.
- **Risk:** Over‑sharing noise. → **Mitigation:** Begin with **minimized views**; expand sharing **only** when it drives measurable outcomes.

## Slide 10 — **Security Is the Feature (Tie‑back to ASML & Cross‑Company Sharing)**
**Template:** **Format 1 — Split (60/40)**
**Nav Pill:** **SECURITY**

### 1) Executive intent
Make explicit that the **primary product requirement**—for Tata and for the Athinia ecosystem—is **knowledge governance**: the ability to share and act on information **without IP spillage**, at scale, **inside** Tata and **across** companies. We tie this to:
- (a) **Transcript‑attributed** allegations of repeated ASML intrusions/document exfiltration;
- (b) the necessity of **object/link‑level access, masking, approvals, audit**, and **purpose‑bound** usage in Foundry/Athinia.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
The transcript frames a world where **hardware levers alone** (export controls) do not fully control capability; **process knowledge** and **decision context** leak more easily if governance is weak. It alleges ASML was **hacked multiple times**, that the **Dutch authorities were “really pissed off,”** and that **civil actions** were brought related to documents that reached China.
**Foundry/Athinia** address this head‑on:
- **Object/link access control** down to the relationship level (e.g., *Lot → RecipeStep* allowed, but *RecipeParam* masked).
- **Row/field masking** and **derived‑view sharing** (share **scores**, **aggregates**, **explanations**, not raw IP).
- **Approvals** and **dual‑control** for sensitive writes; **immutable audit** of who changed what, when, and why.
- **Purpose‑bound** policies (e.g., use for “quality triage,” not competitive reverse‑engineering), paired with **revocation** at any time.
This is how we **move faster, safely**, and how **US‑style centralization of information** (federated, governed) becomes viable at national‑ecosystem scale.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left (60% text):** 3 paragraphs above, with a small “speaker‑attributed context” footnote line.
- **Right (40% image):** Abstract lock/data‑center photo; cool‑desaturated; rounded inner edge 16px; optional teal inline callouts “Access,” “Masking,” “Approvals,” “Audit.”
- **Chrome:** Nav pill “SECURITY”.

### 4) Implementation notes (security admin)
- Define **sensitivity classes** (Public/Partner‑Restricted/Tata‑Confidential/Tata‑Secret) and map to **object types** (Events vs. RecipeParams).
- Enforce **policy bundles** per workspace (Tata internal vs. Athinia cross‑company).
- Require **approvals** for: creating *DefectLineage* linking external supplier lots to internal steps; exporting any unmasked attributes.

### 5) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Partners fear leakage. → **Mitigation:** Demonstrate **masking by default**, *derived views*, and **revocation**; show monthly **audit reports**.

---

## Slide 11 — **90‑Day Pilot: Prove Velocity with Governance Intact**
**Template:** **Format 4 — KPI Grid (6 cards)**
**Nav Pill:** **PILOT‑90D**

### 1) Executive intent
Define **crisp, observable targets** that **prove ONTOLOGY’s velocity advantages** while keeping **governance intact**. These are business‑relevant, auditable, and can be rolled up in a weekly **Slate** to sponsors.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**Targets & precise measurement definitions:**
1) **ETA Variance ↓ ≥15%** (Top‑5 import lanes) — **Definition:** Median absolute error of predicted vs. actual arrival time across the top‑5 lanes by value/volume, measured vs. a **4‑week pre‑pilot baseline**. **Data:** ERP shipments, ASN/carrier events, lane calendars. **Owner:** Supply Control Tower PO.
2) **RCA Time ↓ ≥10%** (3 frequent, high‑impact defects) — **Definition:** Median time from *defect discovery event* to *validated root cause* recorded as *DefectLineage* with review. **Data:** QC, MES, ONTOLOGY events, approvals audit. **Owner:** Manufacturing QE lead.
3) **+2 Engineer‑Built Apps** in production — **Definition:** Two Workshop/Slate apps (e.g., *Lineage Explorer*, *ETA Hotspot*) with **adoption logs** (≥20 weekly active users combined) and **approval trails**. **Owner:** Ops Engineering.
4) **100% Core Coverage (pilot scope)** — **Definition:** *Event*, *Actor*, *Activity*, *Location* populated for scope entities; **coverage dashboard** green for all top‑5 lanes and targeted lines. **Owner:** Data Engineering.
5) **24/7 Rules** live for scope — **Definition:** All pilot rules enabled with owner and SLA; **false‑positive rate** tracked < **10%** by Day 90. **Owner:** Platform PM.
6) **Weekly Executive Slate** — **Definition:** Auto‑generated report with velocity KPIs, top exceptions, corrective actions, and adoption metrics; sent to sponsors every Friday 5pm local. **Owner:** Program PMO.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Title:** “90‑Day Pilot: Prove Velocity (with Governance Intact)”.
- **Six cards:** Each shows **metric name** (24/700), **target**, **definition**, **data**, **owner** in brief (body 14/400).
- Card background `#2C2C2E`; ensure consistent gutters and alignment.

### 4) Instrumentation & acceptance criteria
- **Events to log:** *Saved Exploration*, *Rule Triggered*, *Action Assigned*, *Approval Granted/Rejected*, *Template Used*, *App Session*.
- **Acceptance tests:**
  - *AT‑1:* Recompute ETA variance weekly; show ≥15% reduction by Week 12.
  - *AT‑2:* Sample 20 RCA cases; median time ↓ ≥10%; audit trails intact.
  - *AT‑3:* Verify two apps in prod with usage ≥ targets and clean security posture (no unmasked exports).

### 5) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** KPI gaming. → **Mitigation:** PMO reviews random cases; spot‑check audit logs and masking.
- **Risk:** Data onboarding lag. → **Mitigation:** Narrow scope (top‑5 lanes; 3 defects); prioritize stable feeds.

## Slide 12 — **6–12 Month Roadmap: From Pilot to Ecosystem**
**Template:** **Format 12 — Concentric Timeline/Roadmap**
**Nav Pill:** **ROADMAP‑12M**

### 1) Executive intent
Lay out a **sequenced, compounding plan**: expand data, deepen ONTOLOGY, increase automation, and **activate Athinia** as the **US‑style centralization of information** across key partners.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**M0–3 (Pilot window):**
- **Supply Control Tower** live on top‑5 lanes (ERP + ASN/carrier + lane calendars).
- **Rules** for ETA variance, dwell anomalies; **+2 engineer apps**; weekly **Exec Slate**.
- **Security posture:** Object/link access, masking defaults, approvals; publish **audit report #1**.

**M3–6 (Deepen & extend):**
- Ingest **IoT + QC** for target lines; enable **defect lineage end‑to‑end** (supplier‑lot → recipe step → defect class).
- **Template kits** for *Lineage Explorer* and *ETA Hotspot*; adoption beyond pilot sites.
- **Athinia workspaces**: Stand up **supplier data rooms** for 3–5 strategic partners (masking/derived views by default).
- **Governance:** Joint **Workspace Board** (Tata + suppliers) to review sharing policies and outcomes; publish **audit report #2**.

**M6–12 (Scale & ecosystem compounding):**
- **Supplier risk scoring** (delivery reliability, lead‑time drift, defect correlation) and **semi‑automated RCA suggestions** from AIP proposals.
- Expand **template kits** across new lines/fabs; **training program** for engineers to build/extend apps.
- **Cohorts**: Add logistics and material cohorts in Athinia; roll up **network‑level learnings** (what works generalizes).
- **Governance:** Quarterly **security/usage audit**; policy refinements; publish **audit report #3**.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Left vertical axis:** M0, M3, M6, M12.
- **Concentric clusters (3):** **Supply**, **Manufacturing**, **Ecosystem/Athinia**.
- Each ring labeled with 1–2 crisp deliverables; short sublines for audit/governance.

### 4) Dependencies & resourcing
- **People:** 1 Platform PM, 1 Data Eng lead + 2–3 DEs, 1 Ontologist, 1 Security Admin, 2 SME squads (Supply, Mfg).
- **Contracts:** NDAs + data‑sharing addenda for Athinia workspaces; policy kits ready Day‑1.
- **Change mgmt:** Office hours, enablement for Workshop/Slate builders; Slack/Teams channel with weekly demos.

### 5) Risks & mitigations
- **Risk:** Partner hesitation. → **Mitigation:** Start with **minimized views**; demonstrate early wins; revocation guarantees.
- **Risk:** Analysis paralysis. → **Mitigation:** **Template everything**; bias to ship; review in Slate weekly.

## Slide 13 — **Call to Action: Build the Knowledge Ecosystem (Now)**
**Template:** **Format 2 — Typographic Manifesto (with action bullets)**
**Nav Pill:** **CTA**

### 1) Executive intent
Close decisively with the **operating model** Tata must adopt: ONTOLOGY‑first internally; **Athinia** for US‑style **centralization of information** across firms; measure **velocity**; **template** every win.

### 2) Reading copy (on‑slide, long‑form)
**We won’t out‑produce China. We’ll out‑innovate—together.**
- **Adopt ONTOLOGY‑first** inside Tata: Events/Actors/Activities become the shared language across design, fab, and supply.
- **Stand up Athinia workspaces** with top suppliers to **centralize information**, not ownership—federated, governed, revocable.
- **Measure velocity weekly:** Time‑to‑Insight, Hypothesis Throughput, Decision Latency; publish to **Exec Slate**.
- **Template every win:** Codify explorations → templates → kits; roll across lines, then fabs; extend to partners.
This is how Tata **compresses time‑to‑capability**, rivals China’s speed, and builds a **durable advantage** grounded in knowledge flow, not just megawatts.

### 3) Visual & layout spec
- **Hero:** “Out‑Innovate, Not Out‑Scale.” (96px/900)
- **Sub‑hero:** “Centralize information, not ownership.” (32px/500, teal accent)
- **Action bullets:** 4 bullets above (14px/400); high contrast; generous negative space.

### 4) Immediate next steps (program note, small footer)
- Confirm **pilot scope** (lanes, lines, defects).
- Approve **security policy bundles** and **Workspace Board** charter.
- Kick off **two engineer apps** and **Rule set**; schedule **first Exec Slate** for next Friday.
